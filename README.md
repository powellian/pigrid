# pigrid
CSS Grid / Flexbox system.

A grid building scss setup using a few loops to generate spans for up to 12 grid-row elements, all nestable. It's moderately opinionated for the demo, using colour for the grid items nested inside rows descending from `.pigr-example`. Remove that class and it's colour-inert and ready for production, or tweak to taste.

Fork it and let me know improvements, bearing in mind that it is a first release and very much a WIP - however it's fit  for use *AFIC*.

For convenience this is built into [tris-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/tr1s/tris-webpack-boilerplate). So install the dependencies, fire it up and do what you want. Here are the steps for build etc:
